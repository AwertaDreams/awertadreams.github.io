        <br>
        <span>First, create a new map and name it <code>gmt_minigolf_ANYTHING</code> where ANYTHING is the map name you desire</span>
        <br>
        <span>Make a small box, in which you want to hold the player</span>
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/images/golf01.png" width="500px">
        <h1>1. Making holes</h1>
        <br>
        <span>Now, place down new entity which will be prop_dynamic, and set it to the same model (<code>models/sunabouzu/golf_hole02.mdl</code>) as shown on picture. You want to make sure its in the ground, so we can use it later to make a perfect hole</span>
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/images/golf02.png" width="500px">
        <br>
        <span>Now, make a cylinder shaped block, and place it down the hole. Make sure it kinda matches up with the hole. Hit the carve button while the cylinder is selected.</span>
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/images/golf03.png" width="500px">
        <br>
        <span>You should end up with something like this:</span>
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/images/golf04.png" width="500px">
        <br>
        <span>A perfect hole, who doesn't love that look. Now, select the brush tool, pop down a trigger in that hole. Press <code>ctrl + t</code> to bring up the object properties menu, and set the class to <code>golfhole</code></span>
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/images/golf_unknown.png" width="500px">
        <br>
        <h1>2. Making the map actually playable</h1>
        <span>So, the minimal shit your map needs is a 4 entities.</span>
        <span>They are named: <code>info_player_start, golfwaiting, golfhole, golfstart</code></span>
        
        
        <br>
        <span>In the room you just made, place down <code>golfwaiting</code> - this room will be the "waiting for players to join" room where you practice putts</span>
        <br>
        <code>info_player_start - Spawn for players</code>
        <br>
        <code>golfwaiting - Entity that defines the room where people will practice putts</code>
        <br>
        <code>golfhole - Trigger that upon touching with a minigolf ball will fire</code>
        <br>
        <code>golfstart - Defines the hole. It's name, amount needed for par, and hole number</code>
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/images/golf05.png" width="500px">
        <br>
        <span>Now make a second room, it will be a hole 1 course</span>
        <br>
        <span>Place down <code>info_player_start</code> <span class="warning">Warning: only place one.</span> and place down <code>golfstart</code></code></span>
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/images/golf06.png" width="500px">
        <br>
        <span>Repeat the steps from the waiting room, but dont place down <code>golfwaiting</code></span>
        <br>
        <span>Once you're done making the areas, decorating them etc, compile your map and run it</span>
        <h1>3. Setting the position of holes</h1>
        <span>Once you loaded the map, you want to position yourself over a hole with noclip, and type <code>getpos</code> into console</span>
        <span>The output should look something like this: <code>setpos -374.638000 992.229004 82.795265;setang 88.538010 111.624016 0.000000</code></span>
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/images/golf07.png" width="500px">
        <br>
        <span>Now, go back to hammer, select the hole you were at and click it. Create a new key called "origin" with the setpos value. Example: </span>
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/images/golf08.png" width="500px">
        <br>
        <span>Do this for every other hole in the map</span>
        <br>
        <span>If you wont do this step, flags will appear in weird places</span>
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/images/wrong_flag.png" width="500px">
        <br>
        <span>This is how flags should appear if you repeat the process with every other hole:</span>

        <h1>4. Ending words</h1>
        <span>In every map you need 18 holes, or else the gamemode will freak out. Thanks for reading the guide, i had fun making it. I hope you will have fun like i did :D</span>
